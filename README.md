# Quartet Coalescent Calculator
A Shiny App used to demonstrate effects of branch lengths and rate of gene flow on the frequency of gene trees for a single quartet. Primarily used for teaching purposes but can be used to calculate branch lengths in coalescent units as the number of generations when nucleotide diversity and the mutation rate are known.

## Use
Clone the repo and run the R project file. *app.R* should open in R studio where you can run the application. Assumes R and R studio are installed as well as dependencies.
